<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Digital simulations and serious gaming are offer potential benefits in terms of student engagement, motivation, and learning outcomes. However, there's a dearth of clear empirical evidence regarding their effectiveness,
 and thus, the adoption of these tools largely falls on the instructor or institution's discretion. The lack of a comprehensive policy or guidelines for their integration into educational systems is also a challenge.<p></h4>
	
</ul><h4><p>1. Online Rudeness: The anonymity of the digital world can lead to inappropriate behavior, which can emotionally impact users.<p></h4>
</ul><h4><p>2.Barrier to Physical Play: Digital games and simulations are often sedentary activities ,bad for heath?<p></h4>
</ul><h4><p>3.Addictive Nature of Games: Many games are designed to be addictive.<p></h4>
</ul><h4><p>4. Curriculum Alignment: Not all games are designed with educational goals in mind. <p></h4>
