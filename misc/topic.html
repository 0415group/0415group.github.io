<h1>Skills learnt through digital simulations/games and how they can be useful in daily life.</h1>


</ul><p>The topic of Digital Simulation and Digital Gaming was selected due to the age of time that we live in. Currently, the world is undergoing rapid technological advancements, and those technologies have begun to be used in other aspects of society, such as the education sector. 
From this, we have deemed it relevant as the topic dives into the different levels of how technology is being used in this scene and how it can affect the education of students.</p>
	
<p>For example, the use of Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games allows the user, depending on playstyle, to develop skills that can be used in their daily life, such skills include the advancement of their communication and language. 
However, the difference between learning through the MMO and school, is that the MMO pulls the users attention and allows them to learn whilst experiencing enjoyment and excitement as they play the game.</p>

<p> It also considers STEM education as it revolves around abstract and unconventional games, foreign to the standard user. This causes the user to become motivated while adapting to these foreign styles, 
as well as cultivating their problem-solving skills to solve the issue. </p>
