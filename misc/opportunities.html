<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Through the use of digital simulations and video games, there are ample opportunities for enhancing education and various other fields. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">In today's technology-driven world, digital simulations are typically presented in two forms: "Room setups" or "Virtual/Augmented Reality". These platforms provide users with the ability to learn through trial and error, free from the potential stress of physical injury or property damage. Users can repeat these trials multiple times, progressing at their own pace and reducing the anxiety often associated with physical experimentation. Moreover, these simulations accelerate the user's learning curve by adapting to their individual style and offering customization options. They also contribute to the development of cognitive skills, helping users enhance their memorization and problem-solving abilities, which can be applied in future scenarios. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">These scenarios can be observed in various contexts, such as pilot simulations. In the past, novice pilots had to undergo physical flight training, which carried inherent risks that could lead to catastrophic outcomes due to various factors. However, with the advent of digital simulations, aspiring pilots now have the opportunity to learn in a virtual environment that replicates the sensation of flying and teaches them the fundamental principles. While this method may not be flawless, it is sufficient for modern-day training and will continue to improve over time. These simulations epitomize the advantages of digital training, as they are more cost-effective than renting a small plane for practice and also conserve resources by eliminating the need for physical materials and fuel. Additionally, they offer a stress-free learning environment for pilots, alleviating concerns about crashing or the potential consequences of making mistakes during flight. </p>

	<h3 style="margin-right:150px;">Types of Digital Games</h3>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Of course, opportunities often arise from failures. In the first version of 'Edutainment,' there were limited opportunities due to the lack of technology. Consequently, the edutainment games of that time were deficient in aspects such as game design, repetitive gameplay that led to memorization rather than learning, and the failure to support progressive understanding. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">The second generation of 'Edutainment' took a cognitive approach, focusing on the individual user rather than assuming that all users were the same. This generation primarily emphasized providing feedback to developers in order to improve the third generation, which is where most opportunities emerged. Lastly, In the third generation, a broader perspective was adopted, no longer focusing on specific aspects but rather on the educational aspects of computer games.</p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">According to Gros (2007),"There is a variety of genres of games but there is not one standard classification. Industry, developers, and academics, all use different taxonomies. We will categorize seven major genres:  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">1) Action games (also called platform games)—These games are reaction-based; most of the games of the first generation are action games. <br>
		2) Adventure games—The player solves a number of tests in order to progress through a virtual world. <br>
		3) Fighting games—These games involve fighting against computer-controlled characters or those controlled by other players. <br>
		4) Role-playing games—Human players assume the characteristics of some person or creature.  <br>
		5) Simulations—The player has to succeed within some simplified recreation of a place or situation to achieve a particular goal.  <br>
		6) Sports games—These games are based on sports.  <br>
		7) Strategy games—These games that recreate a historical or fictional situation to allow a player to devise an appropriate strategy to achieve a goal." </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">1) In terms of Action games, these games can help users learn how to respond in different situations and improve their reaction time. This applies to a wide range of games, as the term "Action games" encompasses various fast-paced games that require users to act based on in-game situations. Skills such as quick decision-making and reaction time developed in these games can have a positive impact on a user's daily life. Many people find themselves in situations where they need to think quickly and make decisions based on the information available to them. This is applicable in different workplaces, whether it's an office or a warehouse. Office workers may encounter chaotic situations where they need to find solutions to errors in the filing system, while warehouse workers may need to address ordering issues when the warehouse is backlogged. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">2) Adventure games typically involve solo gameplay and challenge players to navigate unfamiliar environments, such as forests or dystopian settings, by solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles. These games test the player's situational understanding and require them to use their problem-solving skills to progress. The skills developed in adventure games complement those acquired in action games, as they work together harmoniously. Players analyze the situation, make decisions, and create plans for the near future, acting accordingly with the hope that their plan will succeed. These skills are applicable to the average user, as they enhance decision-making and planning abilities in various scenarios. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">3) Among the different categories of games, Fighting games are generally considered to have limited applicability in daily life. The skills acquired from these games are often unrealistic and primarily serve the purpose of entertainment and leisure. While they can provide enjoyment and serve as a fun pastime, the skills developed in fighting games do not typically have direct real-life applications or significant transferability to practical situations. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">4) Role-playing games (RPGs) provide players with the opportunity to assume the role of a different character or persona. Depending on the specific game, players create a fictional identity and engage in various situations and interactions within the game world. RPGs teach the skill of adapting to different circumstances, similar to adventure games, but with the added element of assuming a different identity. By stepping into the shoes of another character, players learn to navigate and manipulate these scenarios, providing them with an escape or a means of exploring different aspects of themselves. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">While the idea of adopting a "fake face" may have negative connotations, in the context of RPGs, it refers to the ability to inhabit a different persona and explore different aspects of one's personality. These skills can have practical applications in the real world, especially in a society where many individuals present themselves differently in different situations to fit in or create a desired image. RPGs can help individuals who may not naturally possess this talent to practice and develop the ability to adapt and create their own persona when necessary. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">5) Digital simulations can be viewed as a form of interactive games, and in essence, every game is a simulation in its own right. Therefore, the skills learned through video games, regardless of genre, ultimately teach the player how to act and respond in different scenarios. For example, Action games simulate fast-paced situations that train the player's ability to react quickly. Adventure games simulate unfamiliar environments where players must devise and execute plans to progress. Each genre offers its own unique simulation that guides the player's actions and decision-making process. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">6) Skills taught through sports games like FIFA, NBA, and Madden are often specific to the particular sports they simulate. These games provide a virtual experience of playing sports and focus on teaching the rules, strategies, and techniques associated with those sports. As a result, the skills acquired from these simulations are primarily applicable to the context of the respective sports. This limits the audience who can benefit from these skills, as they are most relevant to individuals who have an interest in and engage in those specific sports. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">7) Strategy games have a broad appeal, not only because of their engaging gameplay, but also due to the valuable skills they teach. While these games can be found in both the digital and real-world formats, their accessibility is gradually expanding. One classic example of a strategy game is chess, which has endured for centuries and remains a prime illustration of strategic thinking, even in the midst of numerous other game titles available today. Strategy games stimulate the player's mental faculties more than any other genre, as they require careful analysis of the playing field and decision-making based on the roles and abilities of different characters or units. Despite falling under the umbrella term of "strategy game," each game imparts skills in its own unique way. Some games focus on world development, allowing players to learn how to efficiently utilize specific objects and individuals with particular skills to achieve optimal results while minimizing associated risks. </p>
	<h3 style="margin-right:150px;">Physical Opportunities Through Digital Simulations</h3>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Another opportunity that arises from digital simulations is the efficiency of finance. When conducting research and experiments in the real world, these experiments often need to be repeated multiple times, leading to significant financial expenses as resources are used and spent repeatedly. However, with the use of digital simulations, this financial burden is reduced. Users only need to invest money in securing stable simulations and ensuring that the resources within the simulation function as intended. This cuts down costs since there is no need to spend repeatedly on recreating testing sites in the real world. Not only does this reduce the financial burden, but it also eliminates the need to consider the real-world implications. In the event of a malfunction, such as a hypothetical explosion, the money spent on resources will be wasted. Additionally, the real-world testing site may be damaged, resulting in additional expenses for repairs.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">The digital simulation also optimizes the utilization of time during experiments. In a hypothetical scenario where a physical experiment is required, involving numerous resources and demanding full attention, conducting it in the real world would involve spending time on gathering and replenishing resources for each repetition of the experiment. However, by utilizing digital simulations, the user can focus entirely on the experiment itself. The simulation resets the learning environment, eliminating the need to allocate time for resource gathering and reallocating that time for experimentation and research.   </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Digital simulations also has a larger range of accessibility. For example, if one were to conduct and experiment, one would be required to be capable to acquiring the resources required, as well as being physically capable to conducting the experiment to ensure that everything goes according to the pre-existing theory that has likely been created. However, there is a number of people that wish to conduct these experiments but are unable to test their theories due to physical disabilities, financial struggles, or acquiring the resources as they are. And with the use of digital simulations, they are, although not perfectly, able to conduct the basic experiments according to their theory, as digital simulations are done virtually through the user's 'headset' or simulation station. Through the use of these simulations, as mentioned earlier, the availability of resources, the lack of a financial burden more than the simulation itself, as well as the lack of the physical disturbances, allow user that are injured or disabled due to a certain circumstance to conduct their research to their liking.   </p>
