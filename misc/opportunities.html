<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


	<p style="margin-right:150px;"></ul>Through the use of digital simulations and video games, there are ample opportunities for enhancing education and various other fields. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">In today's technology-driven world, digital simulations are typically presented in two forms: "Room setups" or "Virtual/Augmented Reality". These platforms provide users with the ability to learn through trial and error, free from the potential stress of physical injury or property damage. Users can repeat these trials multiple times, progressing at their own pace and reducing the anxiety often associated with physical experimentation. <br>Moreover, these simulations accelerate the user's learning curve by adapting to their individual style and offering customization options. They also contribute to the development of cognitive skills, helping users enhance their memorization and problem-solving abilities, which can be applied in future scenarios. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">These scenarios can be observed in various contexts, such as pilot simulations. In the past, novice pilots had to undergo physical flight training, which carried inherent risks that could lead to catastrophic outcomes due to various factors. However, with the advent of digital simulations, aspiring pilots now have the opportunity to learn in a virtual environment that replicates the sensation of flying and teaches them the fundamental principles. While this method may not be flawless, it is sufficient for modern-day training and will continue to improve over time. These simulations epitomize the advantages of digital training, as they are more cost-effective than renting a small plane for practice and also conserve resources by eliminating the need for physical materials and fuel. Additionally, they offer a stress-free learning environment for pilots, alleviating concerns about crashing or the potential consequences of making mistakes during flight. </p>
	
	<h3 style="margin-right:150px;">Types of Games</h3>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Of course, opportunities often arise from failures. In the first version of 'Edutainment,' there were limited opportunities due to the lack of technology. Consequently, the edutainment games of that time were deficient in aspects such as game design, repetitive gameplay that led to memorization rather than learning, and the failure to support progressive understanding. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">The second generation of edutainment took a cognitive approach, focusing on the individual user rather than assuming that all users were the same. This generation primarily emphasized providing feedback to developers in order to improve the third generation, which is where most opportunities emerged. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">In the third generation, a broader perspective was adopted, no longer focusing on specific aspects but rather on the educational aspects of computer games. </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">"There is a variety of genres of games but there is not one standard classification. Industry, developers, and academics, all use different taxonomies. We will categorize seven major genres:  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">1) Action games (also called platform games)—These games are reaction-based; most of the games of the first generation are action games. <br>
		2) Adventure games—The player solves a number of tests in order to progress through a virtual world. <br>
		3) Fighting games—These games involve fighting against computer-controlled characters or those controlled by other players. <br>
		4) Role-playing games—Human players assume the characteristics of some person or creature.  <br>
		5) Simulations—The player has to succeed within some simplified recreation of a place or situation to achieve a particular goal.  <br>
		6) Sports games—These games are based on sports.  <br>
		7) Strategy games—These games that recreate a historical or fictional situation to allow a player to devise an appropriate strategy to achieve a goal." </p>

	<p style="margin-right:150px;">		Digital Games in Education: The Design of Games-Based Learning Environments (~Page 25) </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">1) In terms of Action Games, these games will force the user to learn how to behave according to certain situations and increase their reaction time. This can be seen throughout many games over the years, and across a large variety of games  as the term 'action games' isn't limited to being on its own. Action games is usually a generalization to clarify that the game is some-what fast paced and will require the user to act according to in-game situations. Skills, such as quick decision making & reaction time, are guaranteed to have an effect on the users daily life as most people find themselves in situations where they must be fast on their feet and make decisions according to information they have. This is seen in every workplace, be it an office or a warehouse, as office workers are sometimes thrown into a chaotic situation where they must quickly find solutions to an error in the filing system or a warehouse worker needing to solve an ordering issue if the warehouse is back-logged.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">2) Adventure Games are generally solo player games that test the players situational understanding. These types of games throw the players into foreign settings, such as forests or dystopian areas, and provide tests that the player must solve to proceed further into the game. These skills are reliable to the average user, in correlation to skills from 'Action Games', as they work together in harmony as the user analyzes the situation and using their decision making skills to create a plan for the near future and act according to that plan in the hopes that it works out.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">3) Out of all categories, Fighting Games tend to be the least helpful in daily life, as the skills learnt from these games are unrealistic and are normally used for the sake of entertainment of the user and a fun past-time activity.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">4) Role-Playing Games make the player act as an alternate persona. Depending on the type of game that is being played, this genre tends to make people create a 'fake face' and act according to that identity. Role-Playing games teaches the skill of adapting to a situation, similar to adventure games, but instead of being yourself in those situations, the user is likely required to be 'someone else' by acting. Through this act, the user manipulates or finds peace in their scenarios and acts as a getaway. Although sometimes in a negative light, these skills are helpful in the daily world more than never, as we live in a society where many people wear a 'fake face' in order to fit in and create their ideal image. These games help others that don’t have that talent learn in a situation and how to theoretically create their own fake face.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">5) Simulations are very straight forward, every game in existence is, by theory, a simulation. Therefore, every skill taught through video  games across all genres teach the user how to act. Action Games are a certain simulation that teach the user to act according to reaction. Adventure Games are simulations that teach how to act according to a plan, etc.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">6) Skills taught through sport games, such as FIFA, NBA, and Madden, tend to be limited to a smaller audience, as the skills in these simulations are limited to the theoretical practices and rules of the sports.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">7) Strategy Games apply to a large audience, not for their gameplay, but also largely being popular due to the skills that are taught through these games. These games are more likely to be found in the real world rather than the digital world, but they are slowly adapting according to the accessibility. Such games are games like chess. Chess has been around for centuries but is still the prime example of a strategy game, even with thousands of other titles being available. These games build the players mind more than any other game as it makes the user analyze the playing field and decide according to the role of each character. Although they all sit under the generalization of 'strategy game', they all teach skills differently. Certain games will teach the skill of world development, which is useful to users as they can learn how to use particular objects and people with certain skills to obtain the best result, as well as minimize risk that comes with such decisions.  </p>
		
	<h3 style="margin-right:150px;">Physical Opportunities Through Digital Simulations</h3>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Another opportunity that arises from digital simulations is the efficiency of finance. When conducting research and experiments in the real world, these experiments often need to be repeated multiple times, leading to significant financial expenses as resources are used and spent repeatedly. However, with the use of digital simulations, this financial burden is reduced. Users only need to invest money in securing stable simulations and ensuring that the resources within the simulation function as intended. This cuts down costs since there is no need to spend repeatedly on recreating testing sites in the real world. Not only does this reduce the financial burden, but it also eliminates the need to consider the real-world implications. In the event of a malfunction, such as a hypothetical explosion, the money spent on resources will be wasted. Additionally, the real-world testing site may be damaged, resulting in additional expenses for repairs.  </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">The digital simulation also optimizes the utilization of time during experiments. In a hypothetical scenario where a physical experiment is required, involving numerous resources and demanding full attention, conducting it in the real world would involve spending time on gathering and replenishing resources for each repetition of the experiment. However, by utilizing digital simulations, the user can focus entirely on the experiment itself. The simulation resets the learning environment, eliminating the need to allocate time for resource gathering and reallocating that time for experimentation and research.   </p>
	<p style="margin-right:150px;">Digital simulations also has a larger range of accessibility. For example, if one were to conduct and experiment, one would be required to be capable to acquiring the resources required, as well as being physically capable to conducting the experiment to ensure that everything goes according to the pre-existing theory that has likely been created. However, there is a number of people that wish to conduct these experiments but are unable to test their theories due to physical disabilities, financial struggles, or acquiring the resources as they are. And with the use of digital simulations, they are, although not perfectly, able to conduct the basic experiments according to their theory, as digital simulations are done virtually through the user's 'headset' or simulation station. Through the use of these simulations, as mentioned earlier, the availability of resources, the lack of a financial burden more than the simulation itself, as well as the lack of the physical disturbances, allow user that are injured or disabled due to a certain circumstance to conduct their research to their liking.   </p>
