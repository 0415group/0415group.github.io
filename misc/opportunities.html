<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


	<p></ul>Through the use of digital simulations and video games, this provides opportunity to the education scene and other places as a whole.</p>
	<p>Through modern day technology, digital simulations are generally put forward through two ways, either room setups, or Virtual/Augmented Reality. Through these, the user can learn through trial and error without the stress of physical injury or destruction of property. 
	By this, the user can repeat said trial numerous times and proceed at their own rate, reducing the stress often felt through physical experimentation. These simulations tend to speed up the learning rate of the user as it appeals to the user by adapting 
	to their style and being customizable to the user. It also allows the user to advance cognitive skills as it helps the user build memorization and problem-solving skills that can be used in future use.</p>
